# React Library Starter

A simple starting point for developing React component libraries. Inspired by [this repository](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/react-modern-library-boilerplate), which powers the `create-react-library` CLI, but uses Storybook for live preview instead of a `create-react-app` example app.

## What's included?

- Support for unit testing with Jest
- A Storybook environment for live preview
- Rollup for building the pacakge

## How to Use

Simple clone the repository, update `package.json` and this readme with your package details and start hacking.
